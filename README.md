backender

STEP 1. Get backender : To get started you need to pull down backender from npm. This will enable you set up a back-end api

npm install backender

STEP 2 (OPTIONAL). Get testbuilder To setup the environment so that you can add steps and tests, pull down backender-testbuilder from npm

npm i backender-testbuilder

STEP 3. Provide settings : Now the last step is to create a settings.json file with details of how you want the api endpoint to behave

The simplest settings.json file content looks like this

{

"config": [{

    "apiport": 8891

}]
}
